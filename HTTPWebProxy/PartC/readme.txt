Configure the browser to use my proxy server:
Use Firefox 15 and make the changes as mentioned in the assignment so that the browser uses my proxy. 

The final version of the web proxy identifies malware by querying the cymru website.To reiterate, this web proxy identifies all the malware that are identfied as malware.

If the malware file has been returned from the server, the proxy creates a HTML pageindicating the that the file returned is malware. The proxy server sends the response back if the file requested is not malware.

I downloaded 7 - 8 educational malwares from the website. All but one were correctly identified as malware. Maybe cymru doesn't recoginize that malware as malware.
